## Overview

[Wilder World](https://wilderworld.com) is an Immersive 3D Universe powered entirely by NFTs.

In collaboration with Zero.Space, Wilder World enables multi-leveled, photorealistic and mixed reality worlds where Wilders roam freely, acquire virtual land and express themselves through unique avatars, decorative assets and fashionable accessories. 
Wilder World is fully owned and governed by its community â€” creators, players and fans alike are enabled to participate via the Wilder DAO on the Ethereum blockchain.
