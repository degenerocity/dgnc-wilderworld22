## Rarity Calculations

In true Wilder fashion we start with the fundamentals. So first we need to define weights for each of the 120 vehicle models. 
Vehicle models will hold the highest score for all rarity calculations. The more desirable a vehicle is, the less its weight. 
We have data regarding the price of these vehicles and their number of production units IRL, so we will use this as our basis. 
It’s easy to calculate weights using units produced, but it will not be an accurate indicator for desirability. 
Therefore, it will be best to introduce price as a parameter as well.

The most expensive vehicle was sold for $70M, the most inexpensive costs $5,600 IRL. 
The most inexpensive car is the Wustang King Wilder 1978, which means that we should have the largest number of this model in our NFT collection. 
Otherwise we would have rare inexpensive car models, which contradicts our two main principles.
